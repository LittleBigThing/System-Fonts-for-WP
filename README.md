# Modern Font Stacks for WordPress

This plugin adds a collection of system font stacks to WordPress. After plugin activation, the fonts become available in the Font Library as a collection of ‘Local Fonts’.

The stacks are inspired by [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com) from [Dan Klammer](https://danklammer.com) and by [Ssytem Fonts](https://systemfontsstack.com) from [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/).

The following font stacks are available:

* Sans Serif
* Serif
* Monospace
